                <h1>Posible Problem</h1>
                <p>Blue smoke in a car is typically caused by burning oil in the combustion chamber. 
                    This can result from worn piston rings, valve seals, or a malfunctioning 
                    PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system. The burning oil produces blue-colored 
                    exhaust smoke, indicating internal engine issues that may require attention.
